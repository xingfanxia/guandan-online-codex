Guidance for Claude Code (and other AI assistants) working on **guandan-online**.

## Project overview

Real online multiplayer Guandan (掼蛋) — landscape-first web game. 4 / 6 / 8 player rooms, AI bots with multiple difficulties, auto-sort hand, custom rules per room, invite links, real-time play.

Companion to sibling `../guandan-scorer` (in-person scoring/tracking app). This project is the actual playable game; the scorer was scoring-only.

## Current phase

**Research → Design → Plan → Implementation.** Currently in research phase. Findings live under `docs/research/`. No implementation has begun.

DO NOT skip ahead to code. Subsequent phases gate on completed prior phase:

1. Research (`docs/research/*`) — investigate AI engines, rules, architecture, mobile UX
2. Design doc — single-page spec, user-approved before plan
3. Implementation plan — milestone breakdown (`<MILESTONE>-N: description` naming)
4. Implementation — phased delivery with own-merge autonomy per `feedback_solo_project_autonomy` in sibling project's memory

## Domain references

- **Sibling rule engine** — `../guandan-scorer/src/game/` (calculator.js, rules.js) has working A-level / 4-6-8 mode / upgrade logic. Reuse where possible.
- **Existing scorer themes** — sibling has 5 production themes (broadcast / linear / trading / atelier / teatable) with proven visual tokens. May or may not transplant; the game UI has very different needs from a scorer.
- **Research findings** — see `docs/research/README.md` for the index.

## What this app is NOT

- Not a fork or rewrite of guandan-scorer. Scorer continues to exist for in-person scoring.
- Not a single-device pass-and-play game. This is real online multiplayer.
- Not portrait-mode. Landscape only on mobile (forced via CSS + orientation prompt fallback).

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Premature architecture choices before research completes
- Cloning sibling project's structure wholesale — different problem domain
- Stub AI bots that play randomly — the brief explicitly asks for **different difficulties**, so AI quality matters

## Layout conventions

Follow the global file-organization rules from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
- Docs → `docs/<topic>/`
- Adhoc scripts → `scripts/<topic>/`
- No flat dumps at repo root

## Last updated

Initial scaffold: 2026-05-16 (research phase begin)
