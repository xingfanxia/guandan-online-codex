# Master Execution Plan — Guandan Online v1

**Created**: 2026-05-16
**Status**: Draft for execution. Derives from 13 research streams. See [`README.md`](README.md) for source links.
**Total scope**: ~30 milestones across 6 phases (P0–P5), ~7-8 weeks full-time for a single engineer.
**Convention**: `<MILESTONE>-N: <description>` per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Each milestone is a single PR / merge unit.

**Codex build amendment (2026-05-18)**: `guandan-online-codex` is isolated from the scorer. AUTH-2 is canceled, no scorer DB/key migration is required, and all deployed env vars must point at a dedicated online Redis/Upstash project.

---

## Goal

Ship a real online multiplayer Guandan game with the following capabilities at v1:

1. Landscape-mobile-first (iPhone Safari + Android Chrome) + desktop dual-render
2. 4-player partner mode, fully featured (rules / tribute / A-level / level-up)
3. 6-player and 8-player layouts (rules engine same; AI tier limited to Easy + Medium)
4. 3 AI difficulty tiers (Easy / Medium / Hard) selectable per bot slot
5. Mix of N humans + (M = mode_size - N) bots in same room, any combo
6. Player assistance: auto-sort (理牌) + suggested move (提示) + wildcard substitution UI
7. Custom rule axes per room (A-level strict / 抗贡 condition / bomb hierarchy / etc.)
8. Anonymous @handle login owned by the online game
9. Realtime via Vercel SSE+POST + Upstash Redis pub/sub
10. Anti-cheat baseline: rate-limit + IP throttle + report + admin dashboard
11. Production-ready: custom domain, client-side latency beacons, error tracking

**Out of scope for v1**: ranked mode + Elo ladder (POLISH-3), DanLM Master tier (POLISH-4), sound design (POLISH-2), full animation choreography (POLISH-1), PRC Tencent mirror (DEPLOY-3 — conditional).

---

## Success criteria for v1 launch

- 1 human + 3 Easy bots can complete a full 4P game in landscape mobile on iPhone 14 Pro (Safari) and Pixel 7 (Chrome) without errors
- 4 humans can complete a full 4P game with real-time card play, including tribute and A-level final
- 8 humans + 0 bots can complete a full 8P game
- 1 human + 7 bots (mix Easy + Medium) can complete a full 8P game
- Mid-game DC + reconnect within 60s preserves game state
- Mid-game DC > 60s promotes the slot to Medium bot, game continues
- Hidden state never leaks: tested via grep + unit test forbidding `redis.publish(` outside `lib/realtime/payload.ts`
- Move-submit p95 < 200ms from West Coast US (where Vercel POPs are)
- Custom domain serves traffic over HTTPS with valid cert
- ADMIN_TOKEN-gated admin dashboard works for ban / reset / view-report flows

## Dependency graph

```
P0  CORE-1 ── CORE-2 ── NET-3
    AUTH-1 ─┘
    NET-1 ── NET-2 ──── NET-3

P1  UI-1 ── UI-2 ── ROOM-1 ── AI-1
P2  UI-3 ── ROOM-2 ── ROOM-3

```

CORE-1 blocks everything. NET-1 / NET-3 block everything that exchanges state with client. The old AUTH-2 scorer migration is no longer part of this fork.

---

## Phase 0 · Foundation (week 1-2)

Goal: ship the rules engine, transport layer, auth bridge, and hidden-state filter. After P0, two browsers can exchange game-state messages over Vercel SSE+POST with Redis pub/sub; rules engine validates moves correctly.

### CORE-1 · Rules engine port

**Goal**: Port `hash-panda/guandan-guide` TypeScript trick / hand-recognition engine into our codebase. Add 4/6/8 mode constants from sibling scorer.

**Depends on**: none.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/game/cards.ts` — card type definitions, deck construction, shuffle helper
- `lib/game/patterns.ts` — combo recognition (单 / 对 / 三 / 三带二 / 三连 / 钢板 / 连对 / 顺子 / 同花顺 / 炸 4-8 / 天王炸)
- `lib/game/bomb.ts` — bomb hierarchy comparison (`bombPower()`)
- `lib/game/wildcard.ts` — heart-suit current-level wildcard substitution logic
- `lib/game/levels.ts` — A-level state machine + mode-gated demotion (port from `../guandan-scorer/src/game/rules.js`)
- `lib/game/upgrade.ts` — level upgrade calculation (port from `../guandan-scorer/src/game/calculator.js`)
- `lib/game/mode.ts` — 4/6/8 player mode constants (port from `../guandan-scorer/src/core/config.js`)
- `tests/game/cards.test.ts` — deck construction + shuffle determinism (seeded random)
- `tests/game/patterns.test.ts` — every combo type recognized + rejected variants
- `tests/game/bomb.test.ts` — full bomb hierarchy table verified (4 < 5 < 同花顺 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 天王炸)
- `tests/game/wildcard.test.ts` — wildcard substitutes correctly in all combo types

**Acceptance**:
- `pnpm test lib/game` exits 0 with > 95% line coverage
- 100+ test cases covering all combo types per `docs/research/game-rules.md`
- Engine handles all edge cases from `docs/research/game-rules.md` § "Edge cases & ambiguities"

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/game/*`, `tests/game/*`
**Effort**: 5-7 days (rules complexity + comprehensive test coverage)
**Notes**:
- License check first: `hash-panda/guandan-guide` repo has no stated license → if unclear, port semantics not source
- Use `seedrandom` for deterministic shuffle in tests
- All Chinese game terms commented with English glosses

### CORE-2 · Game state machine

**Goal**: Implement game lifecycle as a state machine — deal → bid (skip in v1, no bid in Guandan) → trick → round-end. Tribute and A-level state handled in CORE-4.

**Depends on**: CORE-1.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/game/state.ts` — `GameState` discriminated union (waiting / dealing / playing / round-end)
- `lib/game/turn.ts` — turn order management (north → east → south → west, or 6P / 8P equivalents)
- `lib/game/trick.ts` — trick orchestration (current leader, pass tracking, when trick completes)
- `lib/game/deal.ts` — shuffle + deal cards (108/162/216 total for 4P/6P/8P, 27 each in every mode)
- `lib/game/move.ts` — `applyMove(state, move)` pure function returning new state or validation error
- `tests/game/state.test.ts` — state transitions tested
- `tests/game/move.test.ts` — `applyMove` rejects illegal moves with specific error codes

**Acceptance**:
- A scripted game (sequence of moves) can drive `GameState` from `waiting` to `round-end` and produce correct level deltas
- All illegal moves are rejected with named error codes (e.g., `ERR_WRONG_TURN`, `ERR_INVALID_COMBO`, `ERR_DOESNT_BEAT_PREVIOUS`)

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/game/state.ts` + `turn.ts` + `trick.ts` + `deal.ts` + `move.ts`, `tests/game/*`
**Effort**: 4-5 days
**Notes**:
- `applyMove` MUST be pure — no IO, no mutations, returns new state
- Hidden state separation: `GameState` is server-internal; clients receive `PlayerView` (per AI plan §2). Define `PlayerView` here, generate via `lib/realtime/payload.ts` (NET-3)

### AUTH-1 · Copy validateOwnershipToken

**Goal**: Implement online-owned handle normalization and ownership-token validation using the scorer's token-hash pattern, without reading scorer data.

**Depends on**: none.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/auth/ownershipToken.ts` — `validateOwnershipToken(handle, token, kvClient)` for online-owned profile records
- `lib/auth/handle.ts` — handle normalization (lowercase, strip @, validate format)
- `tests/auth/ownershipToken.test.ts` — valid + invalid + expired token cases
- `lib/auth/README.md` — explains the independent online namespace and dedicated DB requirement

**Acceptance**:
- Function validates token hashes in constant time
- Tests pass with mocked KV
- Docs state that scorer DB/env vars are not shared

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/auth/*`, `tests/auth/*`
**Effort**: 0.5 days
**Notes**:
- Keep the implementation small and dependency-free
- Do not read `gs:*` or scorer-owned profile keys from this app

### AUTH-2 · Canceled for guandan-online-codex

**Goal**: No work. The Codex build does not share the scorer database, so the scorer key migration is not required.

**Depends on**: none.

**Deliverables**:
- None in scorer
- Verify online env vars point at a dedicated Redis/Upstash project before deployment

**Acceptance**:
- No changes land in `../guandan-scorer`
- No scorer database credentials are added to this repo or the Vercel project

**Files to touch**: none
**Effort**: 0 days
**Notes**:
- Historical Option B details remain in `docs/research/cross-project-integration.md` for context only.

### NET-1 · SSE+POST + Upstash Redis transport scaffold

**Goal**: Implement the realtime transport layer per `docs/research/realtime-sync-deep-dive.md` § 7. POST endpoint for client commands, SSE endpoint for server events, Redis pub/sub for room fanout.

**Depends on**: none (parallel with CORE-1).

**Deliverables**:
- `api/sse/[roomId].ts` — SSE GET endpoint, holds connection open up to 270s, subscribes to per-player Redis channel
- `api/move.ts` — POST endpoint accepts `MoveCommand`, validates, persists to game state, publishes to Redis
- `lib/realtime/messages.ts` — `MessageType` enum + `ServerEvent` discriminated union per realtime-sync-deep-dive.md § 7
  - 16 event types: `room_joined`, `move_played`, `tribute_pending`, `tribute_completed`, `tribute_resolved`, `anti_tribute`, `return_required`, `round_end`, `game_end`, `state_resync`, `player_dc`, `player_reconnect`, `bot_takeover`, `chat_message`, `heartbeat`, `error`
- `lib/realtime/upstash.ts` — typed Redis client wrapper, pub/sub helpers
- `lib/realtime/sse.ts` — SSE serialization (`id:`, `event:`, `data:`, `retry:` per spec)
- `tests/realtime/messages.test.ts` — `MessageType` enum exhaustive (typescript `never` check works)

**Acceptance**:
- `curl -N <sse-url>` holds connection 270s, receives heartbeats every 20s
- `curl -X POST <move-url>` accepts JSON `MoveCommand`, returns 200 or 4xx with named error
- Manual test: open two browser tabs to different `<roomId>` — message from tab A POST appears in tab B SSE within 200ms

**Files to touch**: new — `api/sse/[roomId].ts`, `api/move.ts`, `lib/realtime/*`, `tests/realtime/*`
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Notes**:
- Use Vercel Fluid Compute (300s timeout) — confirmed enabled by default for new projects
- SSE keepalive: comment line `: heartbeat\n\n` every 20s (also serves as GFW idle-timeout mitigation per china-network-deployment.md)
- Per-recipient Redis channel pattern (`game:{roomId}:player:{playerId}`) rather than per-room — move filter work to publisher

### NET-2 · Idempotency keys + Last-Event-ID resume + SSE rotation

**Goal**: Make the transport layer robust to retries, reconnects, and Vercel's 300s SSE limit.

**Depends on**: NET-1.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/realtime/idempotency.ts` — Upstash `SETNX` with `PENDING` sentinel pattern per realtime-sync-deep-dive.md
- `api/move.ts` enhanced to check `moveId` (client-generated UUID) against KV before processing; replay returns cached response
- `lib/realtime/eventLog.ts` — Upstash Redis Streams (`XADD` per published event with auto-incremented ID); `XRANGE` for replay
- `api/sse/[roomId].ts` enhanced to:
  - Read `Last-Event-ID` header on connect → call `XRANGE eventLog (lastId +` to replay missed events
  - Send `id:` field per event per SSE spec
  - At 270s wall-clock, send `retry: 100\n\n` + close (client EventSource auto-reconnects in ~100ms)
- Client-side `lib/client/realtime.ts` — `EventSource` wrapper that tracks last-received `id`, handles reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` header
- `tests/realtime/idempotency.test.ts` — duplicate POST returns same response, doesn't double-apply
- `tests/realtime/resume.test.ts` — SSE reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` replays correctly

**Acceptance**:
- Replay scenario: POST `/move` twice with same `moveId` → state advances only once, both return same response
- Reconnect scenario: client SSE drops mid-game, reconnects with `Last-Event-ID` → server replays missed events, client resumes
- Rotation scenario: SSE connection at 270s receives `retry: 100` + closes, client reconnects within ~100ms with no perceptible gap

**Files to touch**: enhance — `api/sse/[roomId].ts`, `api/move.ts`; new — `lib/realtime/idempotency.ts`, `eventLog.ts`, `lib/client/realtime.ts`
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Notes**:
- Idempotency key TTL: 5 minutes (long enough for retries, short enough not to flood KV)
- Redis Stream max length: 1000 events per room (auto-trim with `XADD ... MAXLEN ~ 1000`)
- ~100ms reconnect gap is hidden by UI animation tweens — verified in realtime-sync-deep-dive.md

### NET-3 · Hidden-state filter (buildClientPayload + grep test) — SECURITY-CRITICAL

**Goal**: Centralize all outgoing-to-client state construction in a single function that filters private hand data per recipient. This is the most security-critical code in the codebase.

**Depends on**: CORE-2 (needs `GameState` + `PlayerView` types), NET-1 (needs `MessageType` enum).

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/realtime/payload.ts` — single exported function:
  ```ts
  export function buildClientPayload(
    playerId: PlayerId,
    event: ServerEvent,
    fullState: GameState,
  ): ClientPayload { ... }
  ```
  - Exhaustive `switch` on `event.type` with TypeScript `never` exhaustiveness check
  - For each event type: extracts public fields + only the recipient's private fields (their hand, their tribute prompt, etc.)
- `tests/realtime/payload.test.ts` — every `MessageType` has a test case verifying:
  - Public fields are included
  - Other players' hands are NEVER included
  - The recipient's own hand IS included when relevant
- `scripts/security/grep-no-leak.sh` — CI script that asserts NO file outside `lib/realtime/payload.ts` calls `redis.publish(` or `client.send(`:
  ```bash
  ! grep -rE 'redis\.publish\(|client\.send\(' src lib api \
    --exclude-dir=node_modules --include='*.ts' \
    | grep -v 'lib/realtime/payload.ts'
  ```
  - Exits non-zero on violation
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` — runs grep-no-leak on every PR
- `lib/realtime/upstash.ts` enhanced to NOT export a generic `publish()` — only export `publishToPlayer(playerId, payload)` which calls `buildClientPayload` first

**Acceptance**:
- All `MessageType` variants tested for hidden-state correctness
- `scripts/security/grep-no-leak.sh` exits 0 on clean tree
- Try to add a line `await redis.publish(channel, JSON.stringify(state))` in some other file → CI fails

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/realtime/payload.ts`, `tests/realtime/payload.test.ts`, `scripts/security/grep-no-leak.sh`, `.github/workflows/security.yml`
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Notes**:
- Treat this as a non-negotiable PR-review item
- Code review checklist for ANY new event type: add to `MessageType` enum → add to `buildClientPayload` switch → add test → green CI
- This is the discipline that replaces Colyseus's `@view` decorator

---

## Phase 1 · Vertical slice (week 3-4)

Goal: 1 human + 3 Easy bots play a complete 4-player game on landscape mobile. End-to-end, no tribute / A-level yet (those land in P3).

### UI-1 · Card primitive + hand + trick + design tokens

**Goal**: Build reusable React components for cards, hand display, trick area. Based on `demos/index.html` and `demos/shared.css`.

**Depends on**: none (frontend can start parallel with P0 backend).

**Deliverables**:
- `src/components/Card.tsx` — single playing card primitive (28px / 40px / 56px size variants)
- `src/components/Hand.tsx` — overlapping row of cards, supports lifted state
- `src/components/Trick.tsx` — center area showing last played combo + metadata
- `src/components/Avatar.tsx` — player avatar with active-state pulse
- `src/styles/tokens.css` — port from `demos/tokens.css`
- `src/styles/components.css` — port from `demos/shared.css`
- `src/stories/Card.stories.tsx` — Storybook (optional but recommended)

**Acceptance**:
- All visual variants from `demos/index.html` render correctly in Vite dev
- 27 cards fit in landscape 800px width without overflow
- Lifted state visible at 28px
- Heart wildcard card shows gold edge + ★ badge

**Files to touch**: new — `src/components/*`, `src/styles/*`
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Notes**:
- Use Unicode suits (♥♦♣♠) + Geist 700 + `tabular-nums` per `docs/research/card-visual-assets.md`
- `letter-spacing: -0.03em` scoped to `.card__rank` for "10" alignment
- No external SVG dependencies

### UI-2 · 4-player table layout + CSS rotate orientation

**Goal**: Build the 4P landscape table. Implement CSS rotate Majsoul-style orientation handling for iOS.

**Depends on**: UI-1.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/screens/GameTable4P.tsx` — wireframe screen #03 from `demos/index.html` made dynamic
- `src/components/OrientationLock.tsx` — hooks: detect orientation, apply CSS rotate when needed, set `--logical-w` / `--logical-h` CSS vars
- `src/lib/orientation.ts` — `useOrientation()` hook returning `{ effective: 'landscape' | 'portrait-rotated' | 'portrait-prompt' }`
- `src/screens/RotatePrompt.tsx` — fallback overlay (rare path)
- E2E test: `tests/e2e/orientation.spec.ts` — Playwright tests in mobile landscape + portrait viewports

**Acceptance**:
- iPhone 14 Pro landscape (Safari): native landscape, no rotation
- iPhone 14 Pro portrait (Safari): CSS rotate applied, game displays landscape on portrait phone
- Pixel 7 landscape (Chrome): native landscape with `screen.orientation.lock('landscape')` after fullscreen
- Pixel 7 portrait (Chrome): if lock fails, CSS rotate; if rotate breaks, prompt
- Dev `npm run dev` + open on real device shows all 4 paths working

**Files to touch**: new — `src/screens/GameTable4P.tsx`, `src/components/OrientationLock.tsx`, `RotatePrompt.tsx`, `src/lib/orientation.ts`, `tests/e2e/orientation.spec.ts`
**Effort**: 4-5 days (orientation is fiddly — buffer for cross-device testing)
**Notes**:
- Touch event coordinates pass through CSS transform correctly in 2026 browsers (verified in mobile-landscape-ux.md update)
- Test matrix: iPhone SE / iPhone 14 Pro / iPad / Pixel 7 / Galaxy S22
- Virtual keyboard: temporarily exit rotate when text input focused, re-enter on blur

### CORE-3 · Game-end logic + 4P upgrade rules

**Goal**: Implement round-end + game-end state transitions for 4P mode. Level upgrade per double-down / 1+3 / 1+4 rules.

**Depends on**: CORE-2.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/game/roundEnd.ts` — compute winners + losers + level delta per 4P rules
- `lib/game/gameEnd.ts` — detect game-end condition (team reaches A and wins per current mode rules — strict vs lenient for v1)
- `tests/game/roundEnd.test.ts` — all 4P upgrade scenarios (双下 +3, 1+3 +2, 1+4 +1)
- `tests/game/gameEnd.test.ts` — strict A-mode requires own-A win

**Acceptance**:
- Scripted game completes through 5+ rounds with correct level progression
- Game-end test passes for strict A-mode (must win own A round)
- 6P / 8P upgrade rules deferred to CORE-4 (point thresholds, not 4P table)

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/game/roundEnd.ts`, `gameEnd.ts`, `tests/game/*`
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Notes**:
- 6/8-player mode rules are different (point thresholds, no A-fail counter per memory `project_rules_change_2026-05.md`); land in CORE-4
- Sweep bonus (8P 1-2-3-4 from same team = +4 levels) tested in CORE-4

### AI-1 · Easy + Medium bots inline

**Goal**: Implement Easy + Medium AI tiers per `ai-implementation-plan.md` §1. Bots are first-class room participants with their own `PlayerView`.

**Depends on**: CORE-2, NET-3.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/ai/engine.ts` — shared rule-based + WASM solver wrapper
- `lib/ai/bots/easy.ts` — Easy tier: legal-move enumeration + 30% noise injection
- `lib/ai/bots/medium.ts` — Medium tier: rule-based + WASM `rounds-to-empty-hand` + partner-aware
- `lib/ai/wasm/` — Bobgy WASM solver binding (compile from `Bobgy/poker-guandan-strategy` C++ source)
- `lib/ai/coop.ts` — partner cooperation decision (`decidePartnerCoop`)
- `lib/ai/timing.ts` — Beta-distributed bot move delay (800-5500ms) + anti-tell jitter
- `lib/ai/names.ts` — Chinese-friendly bot name generator (@小李 / @豆豆 / @毛毛 / etc.) with tier badge
- `api/move.ts` enhanced — after applying human move, while next-turn-is-bot: compute bot move inline, publish, repeat (10s budget; overflow to tick handler)
- `api/tick.ts` — overflow handler for long bot chains (cron via Vercel scheduled function, every 5s)
- `tests/ai/easy.test.ts`, `tests/ai/medium.test.ts` — bots make legal moves only
- `tests/integration/bot-game.test.ts` — 1 human + 3 Easy bots complete a scripted game

**Acceptance**:
- 1 human + 3 Easy bots completes a 4P game (no tribute) in dev
- Bot moves are legal 100% of time across 100-game self-play
- Bot move latency: Easy < 50ms (inline), Medium < 200ms (inline w/ WASM call)
- Partner-aware test: when partner leads, Medium bot defers (passes with low-card) at least 60% of the time

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/ai/*`, `api/tick.ts`, enhance `api/move.ts`
**Effort**: 7-10 days (AI is the longest single milestone)
**Notes**:
- WASM compile: use Emscripten 3.1.50+, output to `lib/ai/wasm/solver.wasm` (~200 KB)
- Bot timing matters for realism — don't make bots play instantly even when they can
- Hard tier (LLM) lands in AI-2, post P3

### ROOM-1 · Room create / join / leave (minimal)

**Goal**: Bring room lifecycle online — create with 6-char code, join by code, leave. Cleanup on host disconnect.

**Depends on**: NET-1, AUTH-1, CORE-2.

**Deliverables**:
- `api/room/create.ts` — POST creates room with 6-char alphanumeric code, returns code + host token
- `api/room/[code]/join.ts` — POST joins room with @handle + token, returns SSE reconnection token
- `api/room/[code]/leave.ts` — POST leaves room, server reassigns/bots takes over slot
- `lib/room/code.ts` — code generator (6-char alphanumeric, KV collision check)
- `lib/room/lifecycle.ts` — room cleanup (delete from KV after 1h idle, immediate delete on host-quit)
- `tests/room/create.test.ts`, `tests/room/join.test.ts` — happy + error paths

**Acceptance**:
- Create room → code in response → join with code from another tab → both see same room state in SSE
- Leave → other players see `player_dc` event
- Code collision: `KV SETNX` retries up to 5 times before erroring

**Files to touch**: new — `api/room/*`, `lib/room/*`, `tests/room/*`
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Notes**:
- Code format: 3 letters + 3 digits in alternating pattern, ambiguity-safe alphabet (no 0/O, 1/I, Z/2)
- Host token has admin rights (start game, kick, change rules) — separate from join token

### P1 Acceptance gate

After all P1 milestones merge, the following demo must work end-to-end:

1. Open `https://localhost:5173` in iPhone 14 Pro Safari (or equivalent)
2. Create or sign in with an online-owned `@阿祥` handle
3. Create a new 4-player room with default rules
4. Choose "Fill with 3 Easy bots"
5. Game starts immediately
6. Play through to round-end (level upgrade visible)
7. No console errors, no SSE disconnects, no stuck states

If this works, P1 is done.

---

## Phase 2 · Room lifecycle + rule customization (week 4-5)

Goal: real room ecosystem — create with custom rules, browse, share via link, configurable AI fills.

### UI-3 · Landing + room create + lobby + room browser

**Goal**: Build screens #01, #02, #10 from `demos/index.html` as functional UI.

**Depends on**: ROOM-1, UI-1.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/screens/Landing.tsx` — 3 CTAs + active room list
- `src/screens/CreateRoom.tsx` — segmented mode picker + AI fill config + rules toggle + code preview
- `src/screens/RoomBrowser.tsx` — filterable list of public rooms with join-as-spectator option
- `src/screens/Waiting.tsx` — pre-game lobby with slot status + 30s AI countdown
- `src/lib/api/rooms.ts` — typed client for room API
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/lobby-flow.spec.ts`

**Acceptance**:
- Full flow: landing → create → wait for players (or AI countdown) → game starts
- Browse opens public room list, filter by mode, click to join

**Files to touch**: new — `src/screens/Landing.tsx`, `CreateRoom.tsx`, `RoomBrowser.tsx`, `Waiting.tsx`, `src/lib/api/rooms.ts`, `tests/e2e/*`
**Effort**: 3-4 days

### ROOM-2 · Custom rule axes per room

**Goal**: Surface room-creation rule axes per `tribute-ux-deep-dive.md` and `game-rules.md`. Validate at server-side.

**Depends on**: ROOM-1.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/room/rules.ts` — `RoomRules` type + defaults + validators (per axis)
- Rule axes (each toggleable per room at create time):
  - `aLevelStrict`: boolean (default true)
  - `wildcardHeart`: boolean (default true) — disable for "no wildcard" variants
  - `lastCallDeclare` (报警): boolean (default false)
  - `steelPlate` (钢板 — triple run): boolean (default true)
  - `triPair` (三连对): boolean (default true)
  - `straightFlushAboveBomb5`: boolean (default true)
  - `antiTributeMode`: enum `'two-red-jokers' | 'two-jokers-any' | 'off'` (default `'two-red-jokers'`)
  - `tributeCardSelect`: enum `'auto' | 'player-pick'` (default `'auto'`)
  - `returnTributeMax`: enum `'10' | 'J' | 'unlimited'` (default `'10'`)

  - `eightPlayerHandSize`: enum `'13' | '14' | '13-leader-keeps-extra'` (default `'13'`)
- `api/room/create.ts` validates rules + persists to room state
- `lib/game/rules-applied.ts` — hooks that read `RoomRules` and apply (e.g., wildcard substitution gated on `wildcardHeart`)

**Acceptance**:
- Create room with non-default rules → game plays with those rules applied
- Test: create with `wildcardHeart: false` → wildcard substitution is disabled mid-game
- Test: create with `aLevelStrict: false` → game-end fires on any A win

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/room/rules.ts`, `lib/game/rules-applied.ts`; enhance `api/room/create.ts`, `lib/game/*` (multiple files reading rules)
**Effort**: 2-3 days

### ROOM-3 · Room sharing (invite link + browse)

**Goal**: Share room via link (web share API), browse public rooms.

**Depends on**: ROOM-1, UI-3.

**Deliverables**:
- `api/room/list.ts` — GET public rooms with filter params (mode, status)
- `src/components/ShareInvite.tsx` — `navigator.share` if supported, else copy link
- `lib/room/access.ts` — room visibility enum (`public | unlisted | invite-only`)
- Frontend: `/r/[code]` route auto-fills code into join flow
- E2E test: share link → open in another browser → auto-join

**Acceptance**:
- Click share → web share dialog OR clipboard copy
- Paste link in fresh browser → lands on join screen with code pre-filled

**Files to touch**: new — `api/room/list.ts`, `src/components/ShareInvite.tsx`, `lib/room/access.ts`, `src/pages/r/[code].tsx`
**Effort**: 1-2 days

---

## Phase 3 · Full ruleset (week 5-6)

Goal: implement tribute (进贡 / 还贡 / 抗贡) + A-level state machine + game-end choreography. After P3, a full game from start to championship plays correctly.

### TRIBUTE-1 · Tribute phase implementation

**Goal**: Implement tribute server-side per `docs/research/tribute-ux-deep-dive.md`. Direction calc, card auto-pick, 还贡, 抗贡, timeouts. **Includes 2-teams-of-N sweep multi-pair tribute** (6P 3-pair, 8P 4-pair) per tribute-ux-deep-dive.md § Update 2026-05-17.

**Depends on**: CORE-3, NET-3, ROOM-2.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/game/tribute.ts` — direction calculator for 4/6/8 modes (Path A normal + Path B sweep), card-picking logic, anti-tribute detection
- `api/tribute/select.ts` — POST handler for `player-pick` mode (tribute or return)
- `lib/game/state.ts` enhanced — `'tribute-pending' | 'return-pending'` state nodes
- `lib/realtime/messages.ts` extended — 6 new event types per tribute-ux-deep-dive.md (TributeRequiredEvent / ReturnRequiredEvent / TributeCompletedEvent / TributeResolvedEvent / AntiTributeEvent / tribute_return command)
- `tests/game/tribute.test.ts` — all 4P / 6P / 8P direction scenarios + 抗贡 + timeout fallback + 6P/8P sweep multi-pair

**Acceptance**:
- Scripted 4P game: 双下 result → both 3rd + 4th tribute biggest cards → winners 还贡 ≤10
- 抗贡 condition: 4th holds 2 大王 → tribute skipped, banner event published
- Timeout: loser doesn't pick in 15s → server auto-picks biggest card, game continues
- All 4P + 6P canonical + 8P canonical directions tested
- 8P 2-teams-of-4 sweep: 4 simultaneous tribute pairings resolve in parallel, 还贡 follows after

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/game/tribute.ts`, `api/tribute/select.ts`, `tests/game/tribute.test.ts`; enhance — `lib/game/state.ts`, `lib/realtime/messages.ts`
**Effort**: 5-7 days (was 4-5; added day for sweep multi-pair logic)
**Notes**:
- Tribute is the gnarliest game-rule complexity — budget extra time for edge cases
- 6/8 mode direction variants are room-configurable (per ROOM-2's `tributeDirection6p` / `tributeDirection8p`)
- Sweep tribute only triggers in 2-teams-of-N modes (not 4-teams-of-2)

### EXCHANGE-1 · Card exchange optional rule

**Goal**: Implement the optional 换牌 (card-exchange) mechanic — losing team votes after round-end; if >50% pass, all players exchange 3 cards in random direction after tribute.

**Depends on**: TRIBUTE-1, ROOM-2.

**Deliverables**:
- `lib/game/exchange.ts` — vote tally, direction randomization (CW/CCW uniform), card swap orchestration
- `api/exchange/vote.ts` — POST handler for vote casts; aggregates, deadline timer
- `api/exchange/select.ts` — POST handler for 3-card selection per player
- `lib/game/state.ts` enhanced — `'exchange-vote-pending' | 'exchange-select-pending'` state nodes
- `lib/realtime/messages.ts` extended — 6 new event types (ExchangeVoteRequiredEvent, ExchangeVoteCastCommand, ExchangeVoteResolvedEvent, ExchangeSelectRequiredEvent, ExchangeSelectCommand, ExchangeCompletedEvent)
- `tests/game/exchange.test.ts` — vote tally edge cases (tie / unanimous / timeout), CW + CCW direction tested, hand size preservation
- `src/screens/ExchangeVoteModal.tsx` — wireframe S22
- `src/screens/ExchangeSelectModal.tsx` — wireframe S23 (3-card picker + direction diagram)

**Acceptance**:
- Vote opens 15s; if >50% losers vote YES, exchange triggers
- Direction picked server-side, displayed identically to all clients
- All players (incl. winners) must select 3 cards within 15s; timeout = server auto-picks lowest 3
- Hand count preserved post-exchange (each loses 3, gains 3 from neighbor)
- Hidden-state filter: each player's 3 outgoing cards remain private until ExchangeCompletedEvent

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/game/exchange.ts`, `api/exchange/*.ts`, `src/screens/ExchangeVoteModal.tsx`, `src/screens/ExchangeSelectModal.tsx`, `tests/game/exchange.test.ts`; enhance — `lib/game/state.ts`, `lib/realtime/messages.ts`
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Notes**:
- Rule is OFF by default — only triggers if room creator sets `cardExchange: true`
- Voting scope: ONLY losing-team players (winners auto-accept)
- Direction is server-RNG, no player influence — keeps it fair
- Adds 4 new room rule axes to ROOM-2: `cardExchange`, `exchangeVoteThreshold`, `exchangeVoteDuration`, `exchangeCardCount`

### UI-4 · Tribute phase UI

**Goal**: Build modal-style tribute UI per wireframe #04 + the 抗贡 / 还贡 variants.

**Depends on**: TRIBUTE-1, UI-2.

**Deliverables**:
- `src/screens/TributeModal.tsx` — fullscreen overlay with 3 states: `pending` / `anti-tribute-banner` / `return-pending`
- `src/components/TributeAnimation.tsx` — card travel animation (loser hand → trick → winner hand)
- `src/lib/animation/cardTravel.ts` — reusable card travel motion (CSS transform-based, 400-600ms)
- Tribute card selection UI (for `player-pick` mode): tap-to-select among same-rank cards
- E2E test: complete game with tribute, verify modal appears and animation plays

**Acceptance**:
- After 4P round with `1+4` result, tribute modal appears with correct loser → winner direction
- Card travel animation smooth at 60fps on iPhone 14 Pro
- 抗贡 case: banner appears, no tribute UI, game resumes after 2s
- 还贡 phase: winner sees their hand + tributed card, picks return, animation plays back

**Files to touch**: new — `src/screens/TributeModal.tsx`, `src/components/TributeAnimation.tsx`, `src/lib/animation/cardTravel.ts`
**Effort**: 3-4 days

### CORE-4 · 6/8 player mode rules + A-level full machine

- `lib/game/turn-order-multi.ts` — turn order for 6P / 8P
- `tests/game/upgrade-6p.test.ts`, `upgrade-8p.test.ts`, `aLevel.test.ts`

**Acceptance**:
- 8P scripted game: 1-2-3-4 from team A → team A levels up by 4 (sweep bonus)
- 4P A-level: 3 consecutive A-round losses → reset to LV 2
- 6P / 8P: no A-fail counter per scorer memory `project_rules_change_2026-05.md`

**Files to touch**: new — `lib/game/upgrade-6p.ts`, `upgrade-8p.ts`, `aLevel.ts`, `turn-order-multi.ts`, `tests/game/*`

2. 6+ rounds played including tribute (at least one 双下 with 还贡)
3. A-level reached, decisive round plays
4. Victory screen shows correctly
5. No scorer profile sync is attempted; round/game state remains online-owned

---

- `tests/ai/hard.test.ts` — mocked LLM scenarios (good response / bad response / timeout)

**Acceptance**:
- 4P game with 1 human + 3 Hard bots completes
- Bot moves are 100% legal (candidate-mode prompt prevents garbage)
- p95 move latency < 5s (DeepSeek typical: 2-4s)
- Monthly cost dashboard shows actual spend tracking

**Files to touch**: new — `src/lib/assist/*`, `src/components/SortButton.tsx`, `SuggestionHint.tsx`, `WildcardSubDialog.tsx`, `EndgameAssist.tsx`
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Notes**:
- Assistance uses client-side WASM (per ai-implementation-plan.md §11) for instant feedback

- UI: `src/components/PlayerStatusBadge.tsx` shows DC / reconnecting / bot-takeover states
- `tests/integration/dcTakeover.test.ts`

**Acceptance**:
- Kill player tab → after 60s, slot shows "BOT 进阶 (代打)" badge, game continues
- Player rejoins with same token within 5 min → bot retires, human resumes
- After 5 min without reclaim, takeover is permanent for this game
